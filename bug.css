The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages inside a media query. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```css
@media (max-width: calc(100% - 50px)) {
  /* styles */
}
```

The issue is that the `calc()` function doesn't work directly with percentages inside media queries. Instead, you must use viewport units like `vw`.
