The correct way to use `calc()` with percentages inside media queries is to use viewport units (vw, vh) instead of direct percentages.  Here's an example:

```css
@media (max-width: calc(100vw - 50px)) {
  /* styles */
}
```

This uses `100vw`, which represents 100% of the viewport width, allowing `calc()` to perform the calculation correctly.
